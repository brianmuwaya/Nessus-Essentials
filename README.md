<h1>Nessus Home Lab</h1>


<h2>Project description</h2>
In this project, I successfully installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans on Windows 10 hosts. The primary goal was to enhance the security posture of sandbox networks by implementing a comprehensive Vulnerability Management function, which included the following phases: Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, and Verify.
